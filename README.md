# uarizona-salary-app

Streamlit app to illustrate University of Arizona salary data.

Deployed as Heroku at: https://sapp4ua.herokuapp.com

**TL;DR:**<br>
_This is a website providing public salary data for the University of
Arizona. It is a "Choose Your Own Data Science" tool, so just
explore with different "data views" on the sidebar!_

**More information:**<br>
This site was developed to allow easy extraction, analysis, and interpretation of
salary data from the University of Arizona.<br>
It is built and maintained by one volunteer, [Chun Ly](https://astrochun.github.io).

This code is built purely with open-source software, specifically
[`python`](https://python.org), [`streamlit`](https://streamlit.io/),
[`bokeh`](https://bokeh.org/), and [`pandas`](https://pandas.pydata.org/).

The source code is available
[on GitHub!](https://github.com/astrochun/uarizona-salary-app)

If you have suggestions or encounter an issue, please feel free to submit an
issue request [on GitHub](https://github.com/astrochun/uarizona-salary-app/issues)!

As this is open source, we welcome contributions by
[forking](https://github.com/astrochun/uarizona-salary-app/fork) the repository, and
submitting a pull request!

This app was developed because I felt it was an important issue that
requires greater transparency.<br>
I maintain and develop this in my free time. With additional data, I hope to extend
this application's resources.

You can begin your data journey by selecting a "data view" on the sidebar:
    
 1. **Individual Search ðŸ†• : Find all salary data for individual(s)**
 2. Trends: General facts and numbers (e.g. number of employees,
    salary budget, etc.), for each fiscal year
 3. Salary Summary: Statistics and percentile salary data, includes salary histogram
 4. Highest Earners (Updated): Extract data above a minimum salary. Now you can select a given college/division
 5. College/Division Data: Similar to Salary Summary but extracted for each college(s)/division(s)
 6. Department Data: Similar to Salary Summary but extracted for each department(s)

Enjoy!<br>
